      OX=1407694 RepID=A0A097ZRK1_9HIV1
    reason: this is a fusion between two proteins, one is an HIV-1 protein and one
      is a bacterial protein

    header: ">tr|F1AXJ9|F1AXJ9_ORFV PP287 OS=Orf virus OX=10258 PE=4 SV=1"
    reason: this sequence is characterised as a pox virus, but the sequence is also
      present in sheep, deer, water buffalo, and other animals

    header: ">tr|Q8QTC0|Q8QTC0_WSSV WSSV410 OS=White spot syndrome virus OX=92652 PE=4 SV=1"
    reason: this sequence is 100% identical to an IS4 transposase in E. coli
